## Data Sources

*  The first data set that was used to explore the association between sleeping and social factors was downloaded from the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) database.

*  The second data set was from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-and-statistics/adults.html).

## Data Processing and Cleaning

*  For data from the NHANES database: The predictors and the response variable were from different data base in NHANES. First, the the column name for these response variables was changed to appropriate names. The original data included numbers to represent difference levels for each predictor, specific names was also replaced for each number. Then, the response variable related to sleeping was from another data base. For this data set, similar steps was used with dealing with the predictors data set. All column names was converted to appropriate names, and character names also replaced the numbers as well. An extra column was added to the data set:`ave_slp_hr`, which is the average sleeping hours per day, by calculating the mean of the weekday and weekend sleeping hours.
   For the third step, all empty cells was removed. Finally, the two cleaned data sets was joined through the patients' unique sequence number.

## Data Description

#### Social factors related to Sleeping Status Data

The resulting data file of `slp_df` contains a single dataframe with `r nrow(slp_df)` rows of data on `r ncol(slp_df)` variables, the list below is our variables of interest:



  * `seqn`. The sequence number of the candidate.
  * `gender`. Gender of the candidate.
  * `age`. Age of the candidate.
  * `race`. Race of the candidate.
  * `hour`. Time(hour) violation occurred.
  * `education_level`. The education level of the candidate.

  * `trouble_slp`. A response on whether telling the doctor having trouble sleeping.
  * `sleepy_freq`. Average sleeply times during daytime per month.
  * `ave_slp_hr`. Average sleeping hours per day.

## National trends in short sleep duration

Short sleep duration is based on age group recommended hours of sleep per day and defined as less than 7 hours for adults. This plot shows age-adjusted prevalence of adults who reported short sleep duration from 2013 to 2020. Overall, short sleep duration prevalence was higher among males than females across years.

```{r}
year_df=read_csv("data/AdultTrends.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c("female", "male"),
               names_to = "sex",
               values_to = "age_adjust_prev") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=age_adjust_prev,col=sex))+geom_line()+geom_point()+labs(
    title = "National trends in short sleep duration",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Age Adjusted Prevalence %"
    )

year_df+transition_reveal(year)

```

## Education level
 
We first want to get the distribution of sleeping hours less than 7 hours across the five different education levels. We will construct a bar chart tabulating the average sleeping hours per week in each of the five education levels. Gender consideration was also added into to the bar chart in order to see a difference between female and male in each category.

```{r}
 edu_plot=slp_df %>%
  filter(ave_slp_hr<7)%>%
  group_by(education_level,gender) %>%
  summarize(ave_sleep=mean((weekday_slp_hr*5+weekend_slp_hr*2)/7)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(education_level=fct_reorder(education_level,ave_sleep)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=education_level,y=ave_sleep,fill=gender))+ geom_bar(width=0.5,stat="identity")+
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(
    name = "gender",
    discrete = TRUE
  ) + geom_text(aes(label = round(ave_sleep, 2)),position = position_stack(vjust=0.9), color = "white", size = 4)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+labs(
    title = "Distribution of sleeping hours across education level",
    x = "Education Level",
    y = "Average Sleeping hours per day"
    )
edu_plot
  

```

From the above plot, high school graduates has the least sleeping hours, while college graduates or above has the highest. Female and male does not have a significant difference in both groups.

## Race

A heat map was made to visualize sleeping hours less than 7 hours among different races. The below plot indicates that there is a large number of people who has a sleeping hour of 6 hours per day among the Non-Hispanic black group. There are also many Non-Hispanic Whites who has an average of 6 hours per day. 

```{r}
race_plot=slp_df %>%
  filter(ave_slp_hr<7) %>%
  mutate(sleep_ave=(weekday_slp_hr*5+weekend_slp_hr*2)/7) %>%
  group_by(race,sleep_ave) %>%
  summarise(obs=n()) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~sleep_ave, y = ~race, z = ~obs, type = "heatmap", colors = "BuPu"
  ) %>%
  colorbar(title = "Number of People", x = 1, y = 0.5) 
layout(race_plot, xaxis = list(title = "Average Sleeping Hours Per Day"), yaxis = list(title = "Race"))

```
### Race Gender Gap by Education Level

The below plot demonstrates the gender gap in the patients for different races. Male outnumber female for sleeping less than 7 hours per day for all race, except Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic Asian. The bubble represents the degree of the gap, along inlcuding their education level. 

```{r}
gender_plot=slp_df %>%
  filter(ave_slp_hr<7) %>%
  group_by(race,education_level) %>%
  summarize(total_f=sum(gender=="female"),
            total_m=sum(gender=="male"),
            gap=total_m-total_f) %>%
  mutate(text_lable=str_c("Race=",race,"\nEducation level: ", education_level)) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~total_m,y=~total_f,text=~text_lable,color=~race,size=~gap,type="scatter",mode="markers",
          colors="viridis",sizes = c(50, 700), marker = list(opacity = 0.7))

layout(gender_plot, title = "Race Gender Gap by Education Level", xaxis = list(title = "Number of Male Sleeping less than 7 hrs"), yaxis = list(title = "Number of Female Sleeping less than 7 hrs"))

```
## Poverty Status

We can observe that people who are in poverty tend to have less sleeping hours than those who are not in poverty. 

```{r,fig.width=10,fig.asp=.6}
income_df=slp_df %>%
  filter(ave_slp_hr<7) %>%
  mutate(ip_stat=case_when(income_poverty_ratio > 1 ~ "not in poverty",
                           income_poverty_ratio < 1~ "in poverty",
                           income_poverty_ratio == 1~ "in poverty")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weekday_slp_hr,y=ip_stat,fill=ip_stat))+
  geom_density_ridges(
    aes(point_color = ip_stat, point_shape = ip_stat,point_fill=ip_stat),
    alpha = .3, point_alpha = 0.7)+
   scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(2, 4, 6), 
    labels = c("2hrs", "4hrs", "6hrs"),
    limits = c(2, 6)
    )+labs(
    x = " Average Sleeping Hours"
    )
  
box_plot=
  slp_df %>%
  filter(ave_slp_hr<7) %>%
  mutate(ip_stat=case_when(income_poverty_ratio > 1 ~ "not in poverty",
                           income_poverty_ratio < 1~ "in poverty",
                           income_poverty_ratio == 1~ "in poverty")) %>%
  mutate(sleep_ave=(weekday_slp_hr*5+weekend_slp_hr*2)/7) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ip_stat,y=sleep_ave))+geom_boxplot(aes(fill = ip_stat), alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=median(sleep_ave),
            color="red", linetype="dashed"))+
  geom_text(aes(0, median(ave_slp_hr), label = "sleep hours median"), vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0, color = "red")+labs(
    x = " Poverty Status",
    y = "Average Sleeping Hours"
    )

comb=income_df+box_plot
comb+plot_annotation(
  title = "Sleeping Hours By Poverty Status"
) 

```

## Age
A bar plot was made to see the distribution of average sleeping hours less than 7 hours in different age groups. People age between 71 and 80 has the least sleeping hours with about 5.68 hours per day.

```{r}
age_group= slp_df%>%
  filter(ave_slp_hr<7) %>%
  mutate(age_gp=case_when(age>=20 & age<=30 ~ "20-30",
                          age>=31 &age <=40 ~ "31-40",
                          age>=41 &age<=50 ~ "41-50",
                          age>=51 &age<=60 ~ "51-60",
                          age>=61 &age<=70 ~ "61-70",
                          age>=71 & age <=80 ~ "71-80")) %>%
  group_by(age_gp) %>%
  summarise(ave_slp=mean((weekday_slp_hr*5+weekend_slp_hr*2)/7))%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(age_gp=fct_reorder(age_gp,ave_slp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=age_gp,y=ave_slp,fill=age_gp))+ geom_bar(stat="identity")+ scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  geom_text(aes(label = round(ave_slp, 2)),position = position_stack(vjust=0.9), color = "white", size = 4)+labs(x="Age Group",y="Average Sleeping Hours Per Day",title="Distribution of Sleeping Hours across Age Group")

# Statistical Analysis
## Models
### Data
```{r}
df_mod = slp_df %>% 
  select(gender, age, race, education_level, income_poverty_ratio, trouble_slp, sleepy_freq, ave_slp_hr)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
rt = 0.8
sub = sample(1:nrow(df_mod), round(nrow(df_mod)*rt))
data_train = df_mod[sub,]
data_test = df_mod[-sub,]
dim(data_train)
dim(data_test)
```

### Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) 
```{r}
lmraw = lm(ave_slp_hr ~ ., data = data_train)
summary(lmraw)
```

The model driven by multiple linear regression is $sleep\_hour=8.03-0.30I(gender = male)-0.31I(race = Non-Hispanic Black)-0.18I(education_level = college graduate or above)-0.22I(education_level = college or AA degree)-0.05income_poverty_ratio-0.13trouble_slpyes+0.34I(sleepy_freq = 2-4 per month)+0.18I(sleepy_freq = 5-15 per month)+0.39I(sleepy_freq = freqnever)+0.35I(sleepy_freq = freqonce a month)$. We find it strongly relating to 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(lmraw, cex.lab = 1)

```

```{r}
step1 = step(lmraw, direction = 'both', trace=0)
summary(step1)
```

The model after stepwise both direction is $sleep\_hour=8.04-0.30I(gender = male)-0.30I(race = Non-Hispanic Black)+ 0.34I(sleepy_freq = 2-4 per month)+0.18I(sleepy_freq = 5-15 per month)+0.39I(sleepy_freq = freqnever)+0.35I(sleepy_freq = freqonce a month)-0.05income_poverty_ratio-0.13trouble_slpyes-0.18I(education_level = college graduate or above)-0.22I(education_level = college or AA degree)$

#### Testing : Cross-Validation
```{r}
# set.seed(1)
# train = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 100)
# model_caret = train(ave_slp_hr ~ ., data = data_train, method = 'lm', na.action = na.pass)
# model_caret$finalModel
# model_caret
```

```{r}
raw_pred = predict(lmraw, newdata = data_test)

dlm =  data.frame(
    Error = c("MSE", "MAE", "RMSE"), 
    Value = c(mean((data_test$ave_slp_hr - raw_pred)^2),
              caret::MAE(data_test$ave_slp_hr, raw_pred), 
              caret::RMSE(data_test$ave_slp_hr, raw_pred)))

knitr::kable(dlm)
```


```{r}
# raw_pred = predict(lmraw, newdata = data_test)
```

```{r}
# res_raw = residuals(lmraw)
# segments(obs, pred, obs, pred_res)
```

### logistic
```{r}
data_logtrain = data_train %>% 
  mutate(sufficient_slp = ifelse((ave_slp_hr >= 7), 1, 0)) %>% 
  select(-ave_slp_hr)
glmraw = glm(sufficient_slp ~ ., data = data_logtrain, family = binomial)
summary(glmraw)
```

The first logistic model shows the significant predictors are gender, race, education_level, trouble_types, and sleep_freq.

```{r}
step2 = step(glmraw, direction = 'both', trace=0)
summary(step2)
```

The model after stepwise method shows the significant predictors are still gender, race, education_level, trouble_types, and sleep_freq, but the estimated coefficients change.

```{r}
anova(object = glmraw,test = "Chisq")
```

We did model significance test, ANOVA, and determine the significant predictors for logistic regression model are the same from stepwise results.

#### testing
```{r}
data_logtest = data_test %>% 
  mutate(sufficient_slp = ifelse((ave_slp_hr >= 7), 'sufficient', 'insufficient')) %>% 
  select(-ave_slp_hr)
prob2 = predict(object = glmraw, newdata = data_logtest,type = "response")
pred2 = ifelse(prob2 >= 0.5, 'sufficient', 'insufficient')
pred2 = factor(pred2, levels = c('insufficient', 'sufficient'), order=TRUE)
tablog = table(data_logtest$sufficient_slp, pred2)
tablog
```

From the table, we find:
1. the logistic model works well on sufficient sleep. $\frac{1166}{1166+5} = 99.57\%$
2. the logistic model works not well on sufficient sleep. $\frac{6}{6+356} =  0.02\%$
3. the total accuracy of the model prediction is $\frac{1166+6}{1166+5+6+356} = 76.45\%$

#### ROC-AUC curve
```{r}
roc_curve = roc(data_logtest$sufficient_slp, prob2)

x = 1-roc_curve$specificities
y = roc_curve$sensitivities

  labs(x = '1-specificities',y = 'sensitivities', title = 'ROC Curve')
```

```{r}

#### ROC-AUC curve
```{r}
pre_xgb = round(predict(xgb2,newdata = dtest))
table(data_testy$label,pre_xgb,dnn=c("true","pre"))
```

From the table, we find:
1. the logistic model works well on sufficient sleep. $\frac{966}{966+205} = 82.50\%$
2. the logistic model works not well on sufficient sleep. $\frac{81}{81+281} =  22.38\%$
3. the total accuracy of the model prediction is $\frac{81+966}{81+281+966+205} = 68.30\%$

```{r}
# xgboost_roc <- roc(data_testy$label,as.numeric(pre_xgb))
# plot(xgboost_roc, print.auc=TRUE, auc.polygon=TRUE, 
#   grid=c(0.1, 0.2),grid.col=c("green", "red"), 
#   max.auc.polygon=TRUE,auc.polygon.col="skyblue", 
#   print.thres=TRUE,main='ROC curve')
