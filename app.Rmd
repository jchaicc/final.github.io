Just be mindful of when you exercise. Too soon before bedtime exercise might be stimulating. Exercise in the morning that exposes you to bright light will support the body's innate circadian rhythm.

A series of sleep rituals can have a similar impact even in adults. Rituals aid in alerting the body and mind that bedtime is approaching. savor a warm milk glass. Take a shower. As an alternative, try relaxing music.


5. Although an overstuffed stomach might also keep you awake, a grumbling stomach can. Avoid eating a substantial meal two to three hours before bed. Eat a modest, healthy snack (such an apple with a slice of cheese or a few whole-wheat crackers) if you're feeling peckish right before bed to keep you full until breakfast.


6. If you do eat something before going to bed, it shouldn't include wine or chocolate. Caffeine is a stimulant found in chocolate. Unexpectedly, alcohol also has the same result. Although it temporarily induces sleep, it actually acts as a stimulant and prevents sound sleep at night. Avoid anything spicy or acidic, which might cause heartburn, such as citrus fruits and liquids."})

7. Your task list is a mile long and the bills are mounting. Evenings often bring problems from the day to the surface. A stimulus is stress. The fight-or-flight hormones are triggered, which interfere with sleep. Allow yourself enough time to unwind before bed. Learning how to relax can help you sleep better and feel less anxious during the day. Try deep breathing techniques to unwind. Take a long, steady breath in, and then let it out.

8. Three common sleep disorders, including restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, can cause snoring, a burning discomfort in the chest, throat, or stomach. Visit your doctor for a diagnosis if these symptoms are keeping you up at night or making you tired throughout the day."})
