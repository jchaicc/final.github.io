<h2>Sleep &amp; Individual Health</h2>

<p>Not getting enough sleep is linked with chronic diseases and adverse
health conditions[1], threateniing the nation’s overall public health.
Short sleep duration along with other dimensions of poor sleep has been
associated with weight gain and obesity[2], type 2 diabetes[3],
increased risk of hypertension[4], cardiovascular disease[5] and
depression[6, 7]. Sleep deprivation and disorders are also associated
with impaired immune function[8], chronic pain[9], impaired performance,
increased errors, and greater risk of accidents[10].</p>

<h2>Sleep &amp; Public Health</h2>
<p>Intuitively, we tend to believe that sleep is only related to
individual habits like caffeine intake or regular exercise. However,
numerous studies have revealed that sleep is a central problem of public
health, pointing out that differences in quantity or quality of sleep
are related to a variety of biological, economic and social
factors[11].</p>

<p>It was reported in a CDC survey (<a

class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6412a10.htm</a>)
that 35.2% of people with incomes below the poverty line reported
getting less than 6 hours of sleep per day, compared with the proportion
of 27.7% among those with incomes more than four times the poverty line.
The disparities between racial groups are even sharper. A rigorous 2015
study found that compared with whites matched for age and sex, Blacks
were 5 times as likely to sleep for shorter periods. Hispanics and
Chinese Americans were roughly 2 times as likely to get fewer hours of
sleep than whites[12]. Furthermore, sleep deprivation and disorders
could further lead to health problems[13, 14], poor academic and work
performances[15, 16], which deepen inequalities among populations in the
long run.</p>

<h2>Welcome to our project!</h2>
<p>Sleep is a necessary physiological process for individuals,
interacting with several economic, social, and physical factors,
influencing risks of multiple health problems. Therefore, based on
NHANES dataset, we focus on sleep-related public health issues to carry
out our research, hoping to popularize the significance of adequate and
healthy sleep, arousing the public’s health awareness of improving sleep
quality and obtaining adequate sleep duration. We also want to visualize
and discuss the biological, economic, and social factors interacting
with sleep, informing the public and healthcare providers on the
importance of advocating public policy to promoting the nowadays sleep
situation and overall public health.</p>
