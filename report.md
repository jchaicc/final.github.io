Shiny APP We made a questionnaire using Sleep Quality Scale and make
different suggestions about sleeping in our shiny app. Users can answer
the questions, and then they can get a score for their sleeping quality.
The score can be calculated by adding all answers in 1-4 together. The
higher the score is, the poorer the quality of their sleeping is. In the
end, there will be some suggestions to improve usersâ€™ sleeping quality,
which is really useful, because the suggestions are based on many
well-conducted scientific research.
